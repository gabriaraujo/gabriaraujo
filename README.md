### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub! I am Gabriel, a Computer Science student. Through self-study I am building a solid foundation in both frontend and backend technologies and languages. I am currently working on a scientific research in the field of optimization, in order to propose heuristic solutions and modeling in linear programming to the Two-Dimensional Strip Packing Problem (2DSPP), the Ore Mixing Problem (OMP) and the Unrelated Parallel Machine Schedule Problem (UPMSP).

### ðŸ’» I'm working on
- Research project in Optimization Models and Algorithms in Industry 4.0.
- Building personal projects and my portfolio website.
