### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Gabriel, Bachelor in Computer Science. Through self-study, I am building a strong foundation in front-end and back-end technologies and languages. At the academy I worked on a scientific research in the area of optimization, in order to propose heuristic solutions and modeling in linear programming for the Two-Dimensional Strip Packing Problem (2DSPP), the Ore Mixing Problem (OMP) and the Unrelated Parallel Machine Schedule Problem (UPMSP).

### ðŸ’» I'm working on
- Acting as a Software Engineer on an Integrated Natural Gas Processing System.
- Research project in Optimization Models and Algorithms in Industry 4.0.
- Building personal projects and my portfolio website.
